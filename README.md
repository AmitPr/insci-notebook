# INSCI  
The \[In\]teractive \[S\]cientific \[C\]omputing \[I\]nterface  

---
INSCI is an extremely lightweight jupyter notebook-like environment that lives solely in the browser. While Jupyter Notebooks require a python backend to be running on the host computer, INSCI is self-contained, and can be deployed on any site as a static set of files. INSCI is developed using Typescript and styled using LESS. INSCI doesn't depend on any large and/or slow libraries or frameworks, and achieves it's light weight by depending upon only a few smaller libraries:
* [pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) - Python interpretor compiled to WebAssembly.
* [Âµhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml) - Lightweight html rendering framework.
* [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) - Fast LaTeX to HTML library.
* [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) - Small markdown to HTML library.

## Installation
You can clone and run INSCI on your own machine!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmitPr/insci
cd insci && npm i
npm run pack
```

## Usage
INSCI is currently in heavy development, and as such, can only be run by opening the `index.html` file in the distribution folder.

## Work-in-progress Features and Goals
* Adapt Pyodide Loader to run smoothly.
* Javascript and/or Typescript Cells.
* Workflows for loading and saving notebooks as JSON.
* Conversion between Jupyter and INSCI notebooks.
* Plugin system for developers.
* Minimize size impact of CodeMirror
